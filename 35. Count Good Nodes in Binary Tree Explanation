Counting the number of "good nodes" in a binary tree. A "good node" is defined as a node in the binary tree where the value of the node is greater than or equal to the maximum value along the path from the root to that node. 
My followed approach to solve this problem:

1. **Global Variable:**
   - The code uses a global variable `good` to keep track of the count of good nodes throughout the recursion.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The `goodNodes` method is the entry point. It initializes the global variable `good` to 0 and then calls the recursive function `calGoodNodes` with the root of the binary tree and an initial maximum value of `Integer.MIN_VALUE`.

3. **Recursive Function (`calGoodNodes`):**
   - This function takes two parameters - the current node (`root`) and the maximum value along the path to this node (`max`).
   - If the current node is not null:
     - It checks if the value of the current node is greater than or equal to the maximum value (`max`).
     - If the above condition is true, it increments the `good` count.
     - It then updates the maximum value to be the greater of the current maximum and the value of the current node (`max = Math.max(max, root.val)`).
     - Recursively calls itself for both the left and right subtrees of the current node.

4. **Recursion Process:**
   - The recursion continues until it reaches the leaf nodes of the binary tree.
   - During this process, the count of good nodes is updated based on whether each node qualifies as a "good node" according to the defined criteria.

5. **Result:**
   - The final result is the count of good nodes in the entire binary tree, which is stored in the global variable `good`.

I used a recursive depth-first traversal of the binary tree to identify and count the "good nodes" based on the defined criteria. The global variable is used to maintain the count across recursive calls.
