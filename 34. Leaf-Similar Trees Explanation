My solution defines a solution for determining whether the leaf sequences of two binary trees, `root1` and `root2`, are similar. The approach involves traversing both trees to collect their leaf nodes in lists and then comparing the lists for similarity.

approach followed:

1. **Leaf Node Collection:**
   - Two lists, `list1` and `list2`, are created to store the leaf nodes of `root1` and `root2`, respectively.

2. **Leaf Node Extraction Function:**
   - The `getLeafs` function is defined to recursively traverse a binary tree (`TreeNode`).
   - If the current node is not null:
     - If both the left and right child nodes of the current node are null, it means the current node is a leaf node.
     - The value of the leaf node is added to the corresponding list (`list`).
     - Recursively call the `getLeafs` function for the left and right child nodes to continue traversing the tree.

3. **Leaf Node Extraction for Both Trees:**
   - The `getLeafs` function is called for both `root1` and `root2`, populating `list1` and `list2` with the leaf nodes of each tree.

4. **Comparison of Leaf Sequences:**
   - The two lists (`list1` and `list2`) containing leaf nodes are compared using the `equals` method.
   - If the lists are equal, it means the leaf sequences of the two trees are similar.

The main idea is to extract the leaf nodes of each tree and then compare the sequences. This approach leverages the fact that the order of leaf nodes in a binary tree's traversal from left to right corresponds to the order in which the leaves appear in a sequence. If the leaf sequences of both trees are the same, the trees are considered to have similar leaf structures.
