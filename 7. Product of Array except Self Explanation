I implemented the approach known as "prefix and suffix product arrays" to solve the problem of finding the product of every element in an array except itself. Here's an explanation of the approach:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Three arrays are used: `prefix`, `suffix`, and `result`.
   - `prefix` and `suffix` arrays are initialized to store the product of all elements to the left and right of the current element, respectively.
   - `result` array is where the final result will be stored.

2. **Calculating Prefix Products:**
   - The `prefix` array is filled by iterating through the input array from left to right.
   - At each index `i`, `prefix[i]` is calculated as the product of all elements to the left of `nums[i]`. The first element (`prefix[0]`) is initialized to 1.

3. **Calculating Suffix Products:**
   - The `suffix` array is filled by iterating through the input array from right to left.
   - At each index `i`, `suffix[i]` is calculated as the product of all elements to the right of `nums[i]`. The last element (`suffix[nums.length-1]`) is initialized to 1.

4. **Calculating Final Result:**
   - The final result is calculated by multiplying the corresponding elements of the `prefix` and `suffix` arrays.
   - For each index `i`, `result[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i]`.

5. **Returning the Result:**
   - The `result` array, which now contains the product of every element except itself, is returned.

This approach avoids using division and provides a solution in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array. The three passes through the array may seem inefficient, but it ensures that each element is considered in the context of its left and right neighbors, allowing for a simple and efficient calculation of the product of elements except itself.
